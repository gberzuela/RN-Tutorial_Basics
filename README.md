## What I learned:

- FlatList component:
  - Passing data, rendering each item, handling data that doesn't have a 'key' property, and altering number of columns the data is presented
- TouchableOpacity component
- React Native's Alert object
- TouchableWithoutFeedback used to wrap our entire app in a clickable component along with the Keyboard object to dismiss the keyboard when tapping anywhere on the screen
- Flexbox in React Native
